# Attention
**This is a modified version of Jcw87's c2-sans-fight, except with harder attacks. The only changes were the attacks, some text, the "Infinite Loop Detected" function, and sprites, which means that you shouldn't be testing your own custom attacks here. Just go to https://kayos156.github.io/BoundFight to play!**
